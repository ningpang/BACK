# BACK: Few-shot text classiÔ¨Åcation by leveraging bi-directional attention and cross-class knowledge
![Arch Diagram](back_arch.png)

This is the implementation coder for [our paper](http://scis.scichina.com/en/2021/130103.pdf) .

## Dependency
```
pytorch
numpy
```

## Data
The benchmark datasets are the same as the baseline [ARR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06039.pdf), and can be found at [here](https://github.com/YujiaBao/Distributional-Signatures) .
Mainly include Reuters, Huffpost and Fewrel.

## Traning and Eval
Set the hyper-parameter at the argparse in main.py and run it for training and evaluation.

## QA
